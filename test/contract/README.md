# L1 contract scenarios

Replay a scripted list of HTTP requests against a backend, record what comes back
(normalised), and compare a run against a stored baseline. It checks the **interface**,
not the agent: no browser and no model. Its purpose is issue 84's L1 layer, so that a
route can move from the legacy API to the adapter and any change in what a client sees
is caught.

    node test/contract/run.mjs --coverage                       which of the 259 interface rows have a case
    node test/contract/run.mjs --record out.json                record against $E2E_BASE_URL with $E2E_API_TOKEN
    node test/contract/run.mjs --compare test/contract/baselines/legacy-linux.json
    node --test test/contract/*.test.mjs                        the tooling's own tests

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `routes.json` | The interface inventory, parsed from issue 84 (259 rows, handling per row). Not hand-edited: regenerate from the issue if it changes. |
| `cases/*.json` | Scenarios. A step lists `covers: ["GET /api/projects"]` (the row's method and path exactly as in `routes.json`), a `request`, optional `capture` (`{"id": "$.id"}`, used later as `{{id}}`), `expectStatus`, `stream` for SSE, and `always: true` for cleanup that must run after a failure. Every case deletes what it creates. |
| `baselines/legacy-linux.json` | What the legacy API answered, recorded with `--record`. **Read-only for agents**: changing it to make a comparison pass needs a human review. |
| `normalize.mjs` | Ids become `<uuid:N>` (numbered by first appearance), times, digests, workspace ids and the sandbox-specific environment name become placeholders. |

## Rules

- A row is covered when some step names it in `covers`, or its handling is `not-migrated`.
  `--coverage` exits non-zero if a case names a row that is not in the inventory (a typo).
- Recording twice on the same backend must produce identical files; if it does not, fix the
  normaliser, not the baseline.
- The baseline is recorded on the legacy API with no model configured. Cases that need a
  model, a runner or an external service are separate scenarios and say so.

## L2: run event streams

`cases/l2-runs.json` records what a client sees while an agent runs: the event stream of
`GET /api/sessions/:id/runs/:runId/events`, for a text turn, a tool call, approval allowed and
denied, cancel, a provider that rejects the key, a subagent, and resuming with `?after=N`. A case
with a `stub` starts its own scripted model (`stub-model.mjs`: text, a tool call, an HTTP failure,
a delay; one script for the main agent and one for a subagent) and registers it through the API, so
no external model is involved and every case starts from step one.

A stream step can react to an event while it is being read (`reactions`: decide a permission when
`permission.required` arrives, cancel when `run.started` arrives) and can wait for a run to reach a
terminal state (`poll`) so that cleanup does not race the run.

The recording is **profiled** (`profileRunEvents` in `lib.mjs`) so that it does not depend on timing:

- fragments of one response (`assistant.delta`, `assistant.thinking.delta`, `tool.output`) are joined;
- consecutive snapshots of one subagent step collapse to the last;
- the native agent's own evidence (`agent.record` events and each event's `evidence`) is left out,
  because it is internal to that executor and not something another executor has to reproduce.

### Comparing two executors

1. Start the legacy stack on a **fresh data directory** and `--record baselines/legacy-linux.json`.
2. Start the stack you want to check (for example `SCIENCE_AGENT_ADAPTER=1 SCIENCE_AGENT_EXECUTOR=jiuwenswarm`)
   the same way and `--compare` against that file.

`run.mjs` refuses a stack that already holds projects or models. Recording twice on the same stack
must give identical output, and every case removes what it created, so a second run passes the same
check; if it does not, a case leaks or the normaliser misses something.

Which differences matter is a judgement, so they are listed rather than hidden: see
"Known differences between executors" below.

## Known differences between executors

Measured by recording the legacy API's run event streams and comparing the JiuwenSwarm
executor against them (`baselines/legacy-linux.json`, recorded on Linux with bubblewrap).

**Fixed because a comparison showed them** (each has a test in the code that fixed it):

- The native agent announces a response (`assistant.response.started` + `settled`) for every model
  call, even one that only ends in a tool call or a provider error.
- It emits one summed `usage` event after the last model call; subagent usage is built from it.
- A tool runs under the id the model gave it, and after the response of the model call that made it.
- Tool results go through the native `ToolRegistry`: bounded output, neutralised untrusted content,
  redacted and size-bounded `details` (`__detailsBoundary`), the standard error shape.
- A tool receives the arguments the model sent; JiuwenSwarm had filled schema defaults in and dropped
  empty arrays.
- The run keeps the tool round in its final messages, so a session can move back to the native executor.

**Accepted** (`accepted-differences.json`, listed by `--compare`):

- the wording of a provider error (the `errorCode` is the same);
- **a gap, listed here so it is not forgotten**: the native agent attaches *evidence* (`agentRunId`,
  `contextRef`, `stateRef`) to each event and records `context.captured`, `state.committed` and
  `model.completed`. The JiuwenSwarm executor produces none of it, so the trajectory view of such a
  run has nothing to show. Reproducing it needs the executor to record its own context and state.

**Not covered yet**: the native agent's `agent.record` evidence (left out of the profile on purpose),
parallel tool calls, reasoning/thinking streams, `tool_search` and deferred tools (the JiuwenSwarm
executor offers every tool up front), long-running tools, and errors other than a 401.
